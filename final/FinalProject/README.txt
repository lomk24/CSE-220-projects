This final project is OPEN ENDED, and is a performance tracker.

    The point of this program is to create files that allow you to keep track of whether or not you are improving at something.
    The program allows you to create things to track, save them, load them, edit them, and then play them. It then returns with 
    information that allows you to see how many times you did something, and the average time inbetween them. It then gives you 
    the option to save that data.

For example:

    Say you want to keep track of the effeciency of your workout, you can create a file envolving what workouts you will do, 
    assign a button to them, and then when the game starts, every time you hit that button, the time and the instance will be saved.
    
    There are subcategories that you can add as well. Instead of having "curls:c", you can have the Category "Arms" with subcategories
    "curls:c", "pushups:p" ect. Each subcategory adds to the main category. Subcategories have a focus option, printing and showing which 
    one you wanted to focus on. Finally, the program will also print which subcategory you did best at.
